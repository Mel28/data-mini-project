Hello!
This Data visualisation mini project was done as part of my course work through the code institute.
The project was done using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. The data used was example data provided by the code institute.
The web page provides interactive data relating to Gender In Academia, using bar charts and scatter plot graphs to compare genders.
